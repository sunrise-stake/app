# Scenario 5: Unlock Current No NFT

This scenario tests the unlock functionality when:
1. The lock account is already up to date (`updated_to_epoch` == current epoch)
2. The user has no impact NFT
3. No update is needed, direct unlock

## Test Flow

1. **Skip updateLockAccount** - Lock account is already current
2. **unlockGSol** - Direct unlock without any updates

## Key Characteristics

- Lock account has `updated_to_epoch` == current epoch
- No impact NFT accounts exist
- Tests the simplest unlock path
- Only one transaction expected (unlock only)

## Fixture Requirements

This scenario requires:
- Lock account with `updated_to_epoch` matching current epoch
- Remove all NFT-related accounts from Anchor.toml

## Running the Test

```bash
anchor test
```
